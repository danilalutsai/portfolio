# Portfolio

Personal portfolio built with Vue 3, TypeScript and Vite. Terminal-inspired design, strict types, no `any` anywhere.

> **Status:** in development. Building it in public — see [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) for the full roadmap.

## What this is

A portfolio site that looks like a terminal and doubles as a serious TypeScript exercise. Rather than shipping a static one-pager, I'm building something with real features so the type system has to earn its place.

The centrepiece: visitors can browse my Neovim, tmux and Ghostty setup, pick the pieces they like, and download working config files generated from their selection.

---

## Features

**Projects**
Grid of work with live star counts pulled from the GitHub API. Each project has a case study page built from a typed content-block system — text, code, images and callouts render through a single component that the compiler forces me to keep exhaustive.

**Setup**
My actual dotfiles, broken down per tool. Every plugin, keybind and setting is documented, copyable, and addable to a config basket.

**Config Builder**
Pick items across Neovim, tmux and Ghostty. The app generates a real `plugins.lua`, `.tmux.conf` and `ghostty/config` from your selection, ready to copy or download. Selection persists across visits.

**Find Your Setup quiz**
Six questions about how you work. Returns a profile and a recommended starter config that drops straight into the builder.

**Uses**
Hardware and software I run, in a sortable, filterable table built as a fully generic Vue component.

**Contact**
Form validated with Zod — schema first, TypeScript types derived from it.

**Light / dark theme**
Custom palette, respects your OS preference, remembers your choice.

## Design

Terminal aesthetic, website behaviour. Monospace throughout, window chrome on cards, prompt-style headings, a blinking CSS cursor, code blocks that look like terminal output. It's a costume, not an emulator — everything is standard links, buttons and forms, fully keyboard accessible.

Colours live entirely in CSS custom properties. Two themes, one set of variables, no hardcoded values anywhere.

## Tech

| | |
|---|---|
| Framework | Vue 3.5 (Composition API, `<script setup>`) |
| Language | TypeScript 6, strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` |
| Build | Vite 8 |
| Routing | vue-router 5 |
| State | Pinia 4 (setup syntax) |
| Validation | Zod |
| Runtime | Bun |
| Tooling | oxlint, ESLint, Prettier |
| Styling | Plain CSS — custom properties, Grid, Flexbox. No framework. |

No UI library, no CSS framework, no component kit. Everything hand-built, which is the whole point.

## TypeScript approach

The project is also a study exercise. Patterns used throughout:

- **Discriminated unions** for async state, content blocks, config items and quiz questions — with `assertNever` exhaustiveness checks, so adding a variant breaks the build everywhere it isn't handled
- **Branded types** for IDs, so a `SnippetId` can't be passed where a `ProjectId` is expected
- **`as const` arrays** as the single source of truth for tags, tools and themes — types derived from data, never declared twice
- **Generic composables** — `useFetch<T>` with runtime Zod validation, `useLocalStorage<T>`
- **Generic components** — a data table typed to its rows, where a typo in a column key fails to compile
- **Zod at every boundary** — network responses, form input, localStorage reads. Nothing untrusted is cast, everything is parsed.
- **Utility types** in real use — `Extract`, `Omit`, `Partial`, `Record`, `Pick`, `ReturnType`

One rule, held for the whole project: **no `any`.** Where the type is genuinely unknown, it's `unknown` and gets narrowed.

## Running locally

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```sh
bun install
bun dev
```

Other commands:

```sh
bun run build       # type-check + production build
bun run type-check  # vue-tsc, no emit
bun lint            # oxlint + eslint, autofix
bun run format      # prettier
```

The GitHub API is called without authentication (60 requests/hour per IP). Responses are cached in localStorage to stay well under it.

## Structure

```
src/
  types/         # all shared types, one barrel export
  composables/   # useFetch, useLocalStorage, useClipboard
  stores/        # theme, config builder, toasts
  data/          # site content as typed data
  components/    # ui, layout, content, setup, quiz, table
  pages/         # one file per route
  router/
```
